  "framework_context": "This is a Java EE / EJB application. Key conventions:\n- Entity Beans: persistent data objects mapped to database tables, managed by the EJB container.\n- Session Beans (Stateless/Stateful): business logic components. Stateless beans handle single request/response; Stateful beans maintain conversational state.\n- JNDI lookups: the standard way EJB clients locate beans (e.g., java:comp/env/ejb/MyBean).\n- Deployment descriptors (ejb-jar.xml, web.xml): XML files that configure bean properties, security roles, transaction attributes, and resource references.\n- Container-Managed Transactions (CMT): the EJB container automatically manages transaction boundaries.",

For each module, identify: (1) Entity beans and their database mappings, (2) Session beans and the business operations they expose, (3) JNDI lookup patterns and inter-bean dependencies, (4) Transaction and security configuration from deployment descriptors. Highlight aspects that will need architectural changes during migration."
